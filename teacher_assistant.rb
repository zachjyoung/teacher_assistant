# Design a CSV with the data that is provided in implementation details
# Load that CSV into an appropriate data structure that correlates student names with all of their grades.
# Once loaded, list the students and their grades

# With the loaded data, calculate a student's average based on their test scores
# Output each student's name and average score

# Take the average score for each student and assign a correlating letter grade
# If the score is greater than or equal to 90, assign an A
# If the score is greater than or equal to 80 but less than 90, assign a B
# If the score is greater than or equal to 70 but less than 80, assign a C
# If the score is greater than or equal to 60 but less than 70, assign a D
# If the score is less than 60, assign an F
# Output each student's name and final letter grade

# The file should be sorted by last name, first name
# The file should contain the average score (rounded to the first decimal) and the letter grade for each student

# The average score across the class is outputted
# The minimum score across the class is outputted
# The maximum score across the class is outputted
# The standard deviation across the class is outputted

# Acceptance Criteria: 
# * I receive an error if the file does not exist 
# * I receive an error if the file is not the intended extension 
# * I receive an error if an entry doesn't have the same number of grades as the others 
# * If the file is valid, it provides the source data that runs the program
