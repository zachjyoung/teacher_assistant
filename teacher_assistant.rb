# Save into an array
# The average score across the class is outputted
# The minimum score across the class is outputted
# The maximum score across the class is outputted
# The standard deviation across the class is outputted

# The file should be sorted by last name, first name
# The file should contain the average score (rounded to the first decimal) and the letter grade for each student

# Acceptance Criteria: 
# * I receive an error if the file does not exist 
# * I receive an error if the file is not the intended extension 
# * I receive an error if an entry doesn't have the same number of grades as the others 
# * If the file is valid, it provides the source data that runs the program
